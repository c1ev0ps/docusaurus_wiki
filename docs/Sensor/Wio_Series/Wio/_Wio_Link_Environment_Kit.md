We are always closely connected with our surrounding environment. So it is important for us to get some details from an environment. This kit is supposed to do this task perfectly, at least at a primary level. In this kit, you can find common functional modules to collect data, such as humidity or light level indoor, from the environment in our house. The most amazing part of this kit is the Wio Link development board which can be utilized for various purposes, without requiring any programming skills. All the actions you want your modules to perform and the flashing-code operation to Wio Link could be completed with taps in a mobile app. And you can send instructions to your devices over Internet from anywhere. So Wio Link will be a perfect utility to making things around smarter for everyone. So let's get an understanding for those conditions you are in.
