Grove - Alcohol Sensor is a complete alcohol sensor module for Arduino or Seeeduino. It is built with [MQ303A](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Alcohol_Sensor/res/MQ303A.pdf) semiconductor alcohol sensor. It has good sensitivity and fast response to alcohol. It is suitable for making Breathalyzer. This Grove implements all the necessary circuitry for MQ303A like power conditioning and heater power supply. This sensor outputs a voltage inversely proportional to the alcohol concentration in air.

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
The sensor value only reflects the approximated trend of gas concentration in a permissible error range, it DOES NOT represent the exact gas concentration. The detection of certain components in the air usually requires a more precise and costly instrument, which cannot be done with a single gas sensor. If your project is aimed at obtaining the gas concentration at a very precise level, then we do not recommend this gas sensor.

    We've released the [Seeed Gas Sensor Selection Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor_gas/), it will help you choose the gas sensor that best suits your needs.
