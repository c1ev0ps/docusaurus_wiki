## Prerequisites

- Any of the above Jetson devices running JetPack 4.6 with all SDK components installed (check [this wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Tutorial-of-A20X-Carrier-Boards/) for a reference on installation)
- Host PC with Windows, Linux or Mac
- USB webcam or MIPI CSI camera supported by your Jetson device

## Getting started

Deploying your first computer vision project only takes a couple of minutes! By the end of this wiki, you will be able to detect objects on a live video feed from a camera connected to a Jetson device and also on a pre-loaded video file.

1. Setup environment for development computer
2. Setup environment for Jetson device
3. Sign up for alwaysAI account
4. Create a project using alwaysAI dashboard
5. Deploy your project on the Jetson device using development computer
6. Object detection on live video feed from camera
7. Object detection on pre-loaded video file

### Setup environment for development computer

Now you need to setup the development environment. Here you can use either a windows, Linux or Mac computer.

:::note
In this guide, we will use a windows development computer. However, if you want to setup Mac or Linux as your developmenmt PC, please [visit here](https://alwaysai.co/docs/get_started/development_computer_setup.html) to learn more.
:::

- **Step 1.** Download and install alwaysAI desktop application and command-line interface by clicking [here](https://alwaysai.co/installer/windows)

- **Step 2.** After the installation is finished, open a command-line interface and type the following

```sh
aai -v
```

If you see a version number printed, you have successfully installed alwaysAI CLI. The version number at the time of writing this wiki is **1.4.3**

- **Step 3.** Check whether OpenSSH is already installed in your OS. You need OpenSSH on the development machine to connect to your edge device and deploy the machine learning projects.

```sh
ssh -V
```

If you see a version number printed, you have OpenSSH already installed. For example **OpenSSH_for_Windows_8.1p1, LibreSSL 3.0.2**. As of late 2018, Windows 10 supports OpenSSH out of the box. Check out [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) on the Microsoft docs site for more information on installing OpenSSH on Windows

### Setup environment for Jetson device

Next you need to setup the environment on the edge device (Jetson device in this case).

**Step 1.** When running our machine learning project on the Jetson device, edgeIQ runtime is used which is available as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/alwaysai/edgeiq). You do not need to install Docker because it already comes pre-installed with JetPack. However you need to add the "docker" group to your user so that you do not need root priviledges (sudo) to access Docker. Access the Jetson device and execute the following in a terminal

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Step 2.** To apply the new group membership, log out of the Jetson device and back in, or type the following

```sh
su - $USER
```

**Step 3.** Test your docker installation without **sudo**

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

### Sign up for alwaysAI account

- **Step 1.** Visit [this page](https://console.alwaysai.co/auth?register=true) to sign up for an alwaysAI account

- **Step 2.** Fill out the form and click **Sign Up for Free** to finish the sign up process

### Create a project using alwaysAI dashboard

After completing the environment setups on development machine and Jetson device, signing up for an alwaysAI account, we can start to create a new object detection project using alwaysAI dashboard.

**Step 1.** Visit the [alwaysAI dashboard](https://console.alwaysai.co/dashboard) and create a new project by clicking **New Project** button

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/4.png"/></div>

**Step 2.** Choose **Object Detection** as a starting template, enter a project name and click **Create Project**

<div align="center"><img width="{550}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/5.png"/></div>

**Step 3.** Click **Click Here To View Your Project** to enter your newly created project

Now you will see information about the newly created project such as the model used and other useful details

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/6.png"/></div>

For the default **Object Detection Project**, **mobilenet_ssd** is used as the model which has been trained with **Pascal VOC dataset**. This means, this application can recognize **20 objects classes** such as person, bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep, aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train, bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor.

However, this model is not optimized to run for Jetson hardware and will run with very low fps. Therefore we will choose a model which is optimized for **Jetson Xavier NX** with **TensorRT support**.

**Step 4.** Click on the three dots next to the model and click **Delete**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/32.png"/></div>

**Step 5.** Click **Add New Model** and click **Go to Model Catalog** to enter the alwaysAI Model Catalog

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/33.png"/></div>

**Step 6.** Type **ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28_xavier_nx** in the search box and click **+ Use this Model**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/34.png"/></div>

This model which has been trained with **COCO dataset** which can recognize **80 objects classes** such as person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat, traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, bench, bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe, backpack, umbrella, handbag, tie, suitcase, frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket, bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, banana, apple, sandwich, orange, broccoli, carrot, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake, chair, couch, potted plant, bed, dining table, toilet, tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator, book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair drier, toothbrush

**Step 7.** Select the previously created project (My First Project in this case) and click **Add To Project**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/35.png"/></div>

Now we have successfully added the model to our project!

### Deploy your project on the Jetson device using development computer

Now we will deploy the project that we created before on to the Jetson device using the development computer via SSH

**Step 1.** On the development machine, create a new folder, open a command-line interface inside the new folder and type the following

```sh
aai app configure
```

:::note
You wil be prompted to enter the username and password of alwaysAI account when you run the above command for the very first time
:::

**Step 2.** Select the project that you created before on alwaysAI dashboard

<div align="center"><img width= "{720}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/7.png"/></div>

**Step 3.** Choose **Remote device** as **destination**

<div align="center"><img width= "{600}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/8.png"/></div>

**Step 4.** Press **Y** to create the private key file

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/9.png"/></div>

**Step 5.** Click **Add a new device** to add your Jetson device as a remote device

<div align="center"><img width="{570}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/10.png"/></div>

**Step 6.** Choose **device mode** as **Development**

<div align="center"><img width="{570}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/11.png"/></div>

**Step 7.** Enter a **device name**

<div align="center"><img width="{500}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/36.png"/></div>

**Step 8.** Enter the **username** of Jetson device along with **hostname/IP address** as follows

```sh
lakshanthad@192.168.2.156
```

<div align="center"><img width="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/37.png"/></div>

:::note
Here username of Jetson device is **lakshanthad** and IP address is **192.168.2.156**
:::

**Step 9.** Enter the **password** of Jetson device when prompted

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/38.png"/></div>

**Step 10.** When it asks for the **location** to run the app, leave the default location and press **ENTER**. Here the default location is set as **alwaysai/test**. This is the project directory inside the Jetson device

<div align="center"><img width="{750}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/39.png"/></div>

Now we have successfully initialized the project on the Jetson device using the development computer via SSH

<div align="center"><img width="{750}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/17.png"/></div>

Before moving to installing the app on the Jetson device, we need to make a small change in the main code to change the model name and the inference engine type.

**Step 11.** In the directory you created on your PC for alwaysAI, open **app.py** and change the model name and inference engine type as follows

```python
def main():
    obj_detect = edgeiq.ObjectDetection("alwaysai/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28_xavier_nx")
    obj_detect.load(engine=edgeiq.Engine.TENSOR_RT)
```

**Step 12.** Type the following to install the app

```sh
aai app install
```

You will see the following output if it is successfully installed

<div align="center"><img width= "{600}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/40.png"/></div>

:::note
If you encounter errors at this step, you can first try to redeploy using the `aai app install --clean` method. Double check that the jetpack version is the **requested version 4.6. This can be checked by typing the command `sudo apt-cache show nvidia-jetpack`. If the version number is correct, make sure that you completed the Jetson system installation along with the**Jetson SDK components**. This will help you solve most issues.
:::

### Object detection on live video feed from camera

Now we will run the object detection on a live video feed from a USB camera connected to the Jetson device. You can also use MIPI CSI cameras which are supported by the Jetson device that you are using

**Step 1.** Connect USB camera/ MIPI CSI camera to the Jetson device

**Step 2.** Run the following

```sh
aai app start
```

Now you will see the following output on the command-line

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/41.png"/></div>

**Step 3.** Open a web browser and type the **<http://localhost:5000>** to open the video stream

```sh
http://localhost:5000
```

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/person-small.gif"/></div>

As you can see, the people are being detected in real-time and the confidence percentage for each label is shown on the interface. Also the inference time on the **Jetson Xavier** is **0.009s which is about 111 fps**.

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/car-small.gif"/></div>

The above is another demo using the same model.

### Object detection on pre-loaded video file

Here we will run the object detection on a pre-loaded video file.

**Step 1.** Place the video file inside the alwaysAI project directory of Jetson device. According to our example, it is **/home/{username}/alwaysai/test**

**Step 2.** On the development computer, open **app.py** file inside the **test** folder that we created before and replace this section of the code

```sh
with edgeiq.WebcamVideoStream(cam=0) as video_stream, \
                edgeiq.Streamer() as streamer:
```

with this one

```sh
with edgeiq.FileVideoStream(
            'file name goes here', play_realtime=True) as video_stream, \
                edgeiq.Streamer() as streamer:
```

And then replace **file name goes here** with the name of the video file and the file extension. Make sure the filename should be inside single inverted commas.

**Step 3.** Intall the app again

```sh
aai app install
```

**Step 4.** Finally run the app

```sh
aai app start
```

Here you will see the same output on the command line as before, and once you open a web browser with the same address as mentioned before, you will see object detection being performed on the pre-loaded video, giving similar output as before.

### Filter objects to be detected

You can also filter specific objects that you want the model to detect. For example, the above COCO datatset that we used is able to detect 80 object types. However, we can filter to only detect people.

You simply need to add the **results.predictions** line after **results** to **app.py** file

```python
while True:
    frame = video_stream.read()
    results = obj_detect.detect_objects(framconfidence_level=.5)
    results.predictions = edgefilter_predictions_by_label(resulpredictions, ['person'])
    frame = edgeiq.markup_image(
```

## alwaysAI Applications on GitHub

alwaysAI provides a wide-range of ready to use applications on alwaysAI GitHub repository. You can checkout the different applications [here](https://github.com/alwaysai/Reference-Applications).

### License Plate Detector

For demo purposes, we will explain how to deploy one of these applications which is the [License Plate Detector](https://github.com/alwaysai/license-plate-detector) to a Jetson device. So, you can repeat the same steps for other applications as well.

**Step 1.** On the development computer, create a new folder for our project and enter it

**Step 2.** Download [this repo](https://github.com/alwaysai/license-plate-detector) as a **.zip** or clone it if you have **Git** installed on your PC

By default, the model used for this example is not optimized to run on Jetson Nano. Therefore we will first load a Jetson nano optimized model.

**Step 3.** Enter the newly downloaded/ cloned repo, open a command-line inside and execute the following

```sh
aai app models add alwaysai/vehicle_license_mobilenet_ssd_nano
```

**Step 4.** Open **app.py**, change the model name and inference engine

```python
def main():
    obj_detect = edgeiq.ObjectDetection(
            "alwaysai/vehicle_license_mobilenet_ssd_nano")
    obj_detect.load(engine=edgeiq.Engine.TENSOR_RT)
```

**Step 5.** Execute the following

```sh
aai app configure
```

:::note
You wil be prompted to enter the username and password of alwaysAI account when you run the above command for the very first time
:::

**Step 6.** Select **Create new project**

<div align="center"><img width= "{720}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/21.jpg"/></div>

**Step 7.** Type a **Project Name**

**Step 8.** Select to initialize project **As an empty app**

<div align="center"><img width= "{720}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/26.jpg"/></div>

**Step 9.** Repeat the same steps as **Deploy your project on the Jetson device using development computer** section, starting from **Step 3** until **Step 11**

**Step 10.** Once the app is installed on Jetson, run the following command to start the app

```sh
aai app start
```

Now you will see the following output on the command-line

<div align="center"><img width="{700}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/23.jpg"/></div>

As you can see, we are using the **vehicle_license_mobilenet_ssd model** and this model is able to identify vehicles and license plates.

**Step 11.** Open a web browser on your PC and type the following to open the video stream

```sh
http://localhost:5000
```

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/25.gif"/></div>

In this demo, the inference is being performed on the 2 videos [here](https://github.com/alwaysai/license-plate-detector/tree/main/video) and as you can see, the vehicles and the license plates on the video stream are being detected and the confidence percentage for each label is shown on the interface.

### Use Webcam inference

If you want to perform the same inference as above on a real-time video stream from a webcam, please follow the below steps

**Step 1.** Navigate to the folder that we created before for our project and open **app.py**

**Step 2.** Copy and paste the code from [here](https://github.com/lakshanthad/license-plate-detector-webcam/blob/main/app.py)

**Step 3.** Intall the app again

```sh
aai app install
```

**Step 4.** Finally run the app

```sh
aai app start
```

Here you will see the same output on the command line as before, and once you open a web browser with the same address as mentioned before, you will see object detection being performed on a real-time video stream from the webcam giving similar output as before.

## alwaysAI Enterprise Edition

alwaysAI also has an enterprise edition with the following features:

- Access to Freemium with 1 production device deployment for - a year
- 20 Hours of alwaysAI Cloud model training
- 30 days access to alwaysAI Cloud Dataset Storage

You can learn more about alwaysAI Enterprise Edition here.

### Train your own model and deploy

**Step 1.** Prepare your dataset for training. Make sure your dataset is in **PascalVOC format** and then arrange all the images and labels in 2 directories and zip the file as follows

<div align="center"><img width="{350}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/27.jpg"/></div>

**Step 2.** Go to [alwaysAI dashboard](https://console.alwaysai.co/dashboard), click **Datasets** on the left navigation pane and click **Upload a Dataset**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/28.jpg"/></div>

**Step 3.** After the dataset uploading is finished, click **Train**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/29.jpg"/></div>

**Step 4.** Here you can change training settings according to your preference and then click **Start training**

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/30.jpg"/></div>

You will see the following output after the training is finished

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/31.jpg"/></div>

Now the trained model is available in your account. You can use this model on your object detection project as follows

**Step 5.** Navigate to `Models > My Models` and click on the model that we just trained

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/42.png"/></div>

<div align="center"><img width= "{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/alwaysAI/pics/43.png"/></div>

**Step 6.** As you can see, you can use the command below in the root directory of your object detection app

```sh
aai app models add lakshanthad/roadsign-mobilenet
```

**Step 7.** After that change the model name in **app.py** and run the app again

```sh
lakshanthad/roadsign-mobilenet
```
