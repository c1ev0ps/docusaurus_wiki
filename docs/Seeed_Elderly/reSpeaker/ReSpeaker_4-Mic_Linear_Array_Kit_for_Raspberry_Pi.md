Seeedâ€™s ReSpeaker 4-Mic Linear Array Kit is
an extension board, aka HAT designed for Raspberry Pi. It's a linear microphone array
kit, comes with four microphones and
designed for AI and voice applications. That
means you can build a more powerful and
flexible voice product with Raspberry Pi
which can integrate Amazon Alexa Voice
Service, Google Assistant, and so on.

ReSpeaker 4-Mic Linear Array Kit for
Raspberry Pi consists of two boards, one is
voice accessory HAT, another is four
microphones linear array.

ReSpeaker 4-Mic Linear Array Kit for
Raspberry Pi support 8 input & 8 output
channels in Raspberry Pi OS. The first 6
input channels for microphone
recording (only first 4 input channels are
valid capture data), rest of 2 input channel
are echo channel of playback. The first 2
output channel are for sound output, the rest of 6 output
channels are dummy.

### Software

**Step 1. Install seeed-voicecard**

Get the seeed voice card source code. and install all linux kernel drivers.

```
sudo apt-get update
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard
sudo ./install.sh  
sudo reboot

```

**Step 2. Check the Sound Card**

Tap the command below to check the record device.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ arecord -L
```

It should be like:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ arecord -L
null
    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
default
    Playback/recording through the PulseAudio sound server
ac108

```

**Step 3. Record and Play**

You can record then play, or you can record and play at the same time.

```
#It will capture sound on AC108 and save as a.wav
arecord -Dac108 -f S32_LE -r 16000 -c 8 a.wav
#Take care of that the captured mic audio is on the first 6 channels

#It will play sound file a.wav on AC101
aplay -D ac101 a.wav
#Do not use -D plughw:1,0 directly except your wave file is single channel only.

```

:::note
Limit for developer using 4-Mic Linear Array Kit doing capture & playback the same time:

-1. capture must be start first, or else the capture channels will possibly be disorder.

-2. playback output channels must fill with 8 same channels data or 4 same stereo channels data, or else the speaker or headphone will output nothing possibly.

-3. If you want to play and record at the same time, the aplay music file must be mono, or you can not use this command to play.
:::

Also you can play and record with Audacity.

:::tip
        You should open Audacity via VNC or you can just use a monitor to open it
:::

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install audacity
audacity                      // run audacity

```

## Usage overview

To run the following examples, clone <https://github.com/respeaker/4mics_hat.git> repository to your Raspberry Pi

```
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/4mics_hat.git
```

All the Python scripts, mentioned in the examples below can be found inside this repository. To install the necessary dependencies, from mic_hat repository folder, run

```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libatlas-base-dev
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Record sound with Python

We use [PyAudio python library](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) to record sound with Python.

First, run the following script to get the device index number of 2 Mic pi hat:

```
python3 recording_examples/get_device_index.py
```

You will see the device ID as below.

```
Input Device id  2  -  seeed-8mic-voicecard: - (hw:1,0)
```

To record the sound, open ```recording_examples/record.py``` file with nano or other text editor and change  `RESPEAKER_INDEX = 2` to index number of ReSpeaker on your system. Then run python script record.py to make a recording:

```
python3 recording_examples/record.py
```

- Step 6. If you want to extract channel 0 data from 8 channels, have a look at the content of ```record_one_channel.py```. For other channel X, please change [0::8] to [X::8].

```
python3 recording_examples/record_one_channel.py
```

To play the recorded samples you can either use aplay system utility, for example

```bash
aplay -f cd -Dhw:0 output.wav #for Stereo sound
aplay -D plughw:0,0 output_one_channel.wav #for Mono sound from one channel
```

## FAQ

**Q1: There are only 4 Mic in the Mic Array, how could it be 8 channels?**

A1: There are 2 AC108 in this array, and each AC108 chip has 4 channel output. So it comes a total of 8 channels here, 4 of which are for the microphone, two channels for the playback and the the rest 2 channels are not used.

**Q2: If Raspberry can detect ReSpeaker 2-mics hat, but can't detect ReSpeaker 4-mics linear array?**

A2: Please click raspberry -> Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration, then select the Interfaces tab, make sure the 1-Wire is Disabled.
