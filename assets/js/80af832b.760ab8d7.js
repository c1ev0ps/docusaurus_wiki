Extract the archive and place it in your Arduino libraries folder. Open Arduino IDE and choose Examples-> name of your project Inferencing Edge Impulse - > nano_ble33_sense_accelerometer sketch. Our board is similar to Arduino Nano BLE33 Sense, but uses different accelerometer (LIS3DHTR instead of LSM9DS1), so we will need to change the data acquisition section accordingly.
